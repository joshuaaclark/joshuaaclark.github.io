title: 'Overlap, Centrality and the Case of Two Hash-Tags'

Yesterday Reddit banned five subreddits, including the infamous */r/fatpeoplehate*, which promptly kicked off a wave of recriminations, drama and general weirdness. Towards the end of the day I saw a new hash-tag emerging, [\#RedditRevolt](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RedditRevolt&src=tyah). Clicking around I noticed a lot of faces and handles which I had seen in my brief time engaging with \#Gamergate in September (full disclosure, I thought it was silly), which lead me to wonder, what exactly is the overlap between this new hash-tag and the rolling fight that is Gamergate? 

Not wanting to dust off my own twitter scraper I leaned on the excellent [NodeXL](http://nodexl.codeplex.com/) tool and grabbed a mention/re-tweet network from anyone who tweeted the phrase "redditrevolt." Given API limitations and the fact that the \#RedditRevolt discussion was just spinning up I ended up with 971 unique users connected by 2959 relationships.

*#RedditRevolt social network, green indicates people with some form of #Gamergate identifier (see methodology below)*

Given that I was curious about the overlap between Gamergate and redditrevolt the next step was to identify people active on the Gamergate hash-tag who were also tweeting about redditrevolt. Since Gamergate is rather  amorphous, taking pride in [not having leaders](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2nrcgy/Gamergate_brainstorm_youre_all_the_leaders_of/) and low barriers to entry, I settled on a sliding scale test based around a number of different possible signals of membership.

The Gamergate block list is a common but not perfect metric for membership based on whether a user follows a given number of high profile personalities active within the hash-tag. Downloading a [csv](http://s3.amazonaws.com/ggblocklist/usernameSort.txt) of the block list I joined on the data scraped from twitter to pick out users who appear in both data-sets.

Results show that 108 of the 863 users in the data-set are on the block list, or 12.5% of \#RedditRevolt participants. However I was concerned that the block list csv which I found might be a little out of date, so a few more tests were needed. NodeXL provides the tweeted text and user description for all the users in the data-set, so I fired up a bit of regexp to see what proportion of users had \#gg or \#Gamergate either in their tweet or their twitter description.

Aggregating all of these measures together leaves us with a broad metric for assessing the overlap between \#Gamergate and \#RedditRevolt, if a user has a positive value on any of the three aforementioned metrics than they are considered as "Yes" on the following graph.

![](https://github.com/joshuaaclark/joshuaaclark.github.io/blob/master/images/twohash/broadgg-1.png?raw=true)

``` r
table(gra.base$broadgg)
```

    ## 
    ## FALSE  TRUE 
    ##   555   416

With this broad metric 416 users have some form of \#Gamergate affiliation or identification in their profile, tweets or are on the block list. Obviously this is a crude metric in so far as it doesn't capture things like sarcasm, irony or alternative uses of the hash-tag. That being said the fact that almost 43% of the \#RedditRevolt hash-tag has some sort of \#Gamergate overlap is interesting.

Of course all forms of participation in a hash-tag are not created equal. Social network analysis has repeatedly demonstrated that people have different relative power and status in a network based on a number of factors. So let's look at who is more central in \#RedditRevolt given \#Gamergate status.

First up we have in degree and out degree. The former is a measure of how many times people on the hash-tag mentioned or re-tweeted a specific user, while the later reflects how many times the person in question tweeted at or re-tweeted someone else.

Most people are clustered with fairly low in degrees and out degrees, which is to be expected given the [power law nature](http://edgeperspectives.typepad.com/edge_perspectives/images/2007/05/02/edge_perspectives_blog_power_law__3.gif) of most social networks. The majority of the clear outlines are positive on the broad based Gamergate metric, suggesting that some of the movers and shakers on \#RedditRevolt are also active in \#Gamergate.

This conclusion is born out by looking at the [eigenvector centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Using_the_adjacency_matrix_to_find_eigenvector_centrality), which is a metric for assessing the relative influence of a node in a given network. People with higher eigenvector centrality scores tend to be both important in the network and connected to other important people, while lower scores indicate a more peripheral role. The distribution of these scores from the \#RedditRevolt network based on the broad Gamergate metric supports the conclusions from the degree chart.

To sum up, there seems to be an interesting overlap between the \#RedditRevolt and \#Gamergate hash-tags. While not everyone on either tag is automatically enrolled in the other people with \#Gamergate identifiers tend to be more central in the overall network. This is interesting from the perspective of online mobilization and social movements. Often protest groups have a central cohort of dedicated individuals who help shape the discourse that others use to express themselves. The overlap between these two hash-tags may suggest that a group like this is forming around a broad axis while inspiring various forms of expression which represent variations on a theme. Seeing if this central cohort exists and how it adapts and evolves over time may be an interesting case study for communication scholars or sociologists interested in online movements.
